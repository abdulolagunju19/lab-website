The research of the Yue laboratory focuses on *delineating brain mechanisms which coordinate whole-body metabolism*. More specifically, research is conducted to *characterize stress-related hormone signalling pathways in the brain and the neurocircuitry that drive the regulation of hepatic fuel production, namely glucose and lipids, of feeding behaviour, and of body weight gain*.
