The research of the Yue laboratory focuses on *delineating brain mechanisms which coordinate whole-body metabolism*. More specifically, research is conducted to *characterize stress-related hormone signalling pathways in the brain and the neurocircuitry that drive the regulation of hepatic fuel production, namely glucose and lipids, of feeding behaviour, and of body weight gain*. The Yue laboratory encompasses methods in physiology, pharmacology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics. *In vivo* experimental techniques include glucose clamp experiments with tracer dilution methodology to quantify whole-body glucose turnover, hepatic lipoprotein secretion experiments to study lipid metabolism, and energy monitoring systems to investigate feeding and locomotor behaviours in response to brain treatment interventions.
